## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- List-styling in CSS

### What I learned

- The pseudo element `::marker` is new to me. For styling bullet points or serial numbers color, I get familiar with this element.
- The way of increasing  gap between list-text and bullet point or serial numbers.
- The usage procedure of media queries and table borders.
- The horizontal ruling style.
- Margin and Padding related settings. When Padding is applied to the parent element, content takes 100% width of parent element available after padding space is locked. But if padding is applied to the child element, `border-radius` property does not work for child. Again, if margin is applied for child element, it will overflow the parent container.
- The `padding-left` property for `ul/ol`  and for `li` does not do the same thing.
- Selecting `table` element related elements using `:first-child/ :last-child` use-cases.

### Continued development

- I want to learn how to align smaller sized (than text itself) bullet points with list-text as vertically to centre.
